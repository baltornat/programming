With security set to Medium, there is some input sanitization, but only on the Message box.
On the Name's box there is only a check for the string <script> but not for <Script>.
Name seems to be attackable but unfortunatly the max length of the input is just 10 chars.
We can right-click Name's box and increment max-length to 100 and try the following command:

<Script>alert(document.cookie)</Script>

With the command above we injected the code successfully.
